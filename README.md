# goddb_task

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

Overview
This project uses Cubit for state management to ensure a clear and maintainable architecture.
For local data storage, it leverages both Hive and Shared Preferences to persist user data and settings efficiently.

Technologies Used
Cubit (Bloc) – for predictable and lightweight state management.

Hive – a fast and lightweight NoSQL database for structured local storage.

Shared Preferences – for storing simple key-value pairs locally.
